# HybridGS
Official code of "HybridGS: High-Efficiency Gaussian Splatting Data Compression using Dual-Channel Sparse Representation and Point Cloud Encoder"

Note: due to the license requirement of Qualcomm, our code will be released around August 1st to December 30th.

Updates: we intend to opensource the solution, pending our sponsor's review and align with their MPEG meeting schedule (around Oct.).
